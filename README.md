# Machine-Learning
Created a MLP feed-forward artificial neural network model for the purposes of classifying images as 'memorable' or not 'memorable' for a Kaggle competition. 

Each image is to be represented by 4608-dimensional feature vector that is a concatenation of 4096-dimensional deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) features extracted from the fc7 activation layer of Caffe Net and 512-dimensional GIST features.

Posted here largely just for my (and anybody else's) reference, as the competition has now been and gone. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/brighton-a-memorable-city)
